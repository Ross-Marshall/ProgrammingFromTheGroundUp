#PURPOSE:	Program to illustrate how functions work
#		This program will compute the value of
#		2^3 + 5^2
#

#
# Everything in the main program is stored in registers,
# so the data section doesn’t have anything.
#
# Modified for 64 bit compilation (eax ==> rax, ebx ==> rbx, etc...)

	push $3			#push second argument
	push $2			#push first argument
	call power		#call the function
	add $16, %rsp		#move the stack pointer back

	push %rax 		#save the first answer before
				#calling the next function

	push $5			#push first argument
	call power		#call the function
	add $16, %rsp		#move the stack pointer back

				#in %rax. We saved the	
				#first answer onto the stack,	
				#so now we can just pop it	
				#out into %rbx

# PURPOSE: This function is used to compute		
# the value of a number raised to		
# a power.		
#		
# INPUT: First argument - the base number		
# Second argument - the power to		
# raise it to		
#		
# OUTPUT: Will give the result as a return value		
#		
# NOTES: The power must be 1 or greater		
#		
# VARIABLES:		
# %rbx - holds the base number		
# %ecx - holds the power		
#		
#  -4(%ebp) - holds the current result		
#		
#  %rax is used for temporary storage		
#
