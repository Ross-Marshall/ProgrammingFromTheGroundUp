# PURPOSE - 	Given a number, this program computes the	
#  		factorial. For example, the factorial of	
#  		3 is 3 * 2 * 1, or 6. The factorial of	
#  		4 is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, or 24, and so on.	
# 	
# 	This program shows how to call a function recursively.	
#	Change mull to mulq for 64 bit

	push %rbp		# standard function stuff - we have to

				# returning, so we have to push it
	
	movq %rsp, %rbp 	# This is because we donâ€™t want to modify	
				# the stack pointer, so we use %rbp.

	movq %r8, %rax 		# This moves the first argument to %rax	
				# 8(%rbp) holds the return address, and
				# 16(%rbp) holds the first parameter

	decq %r8		# otherwise, decrease the value
	
	cmpq $1, %r8		# If the number is 1, that is our base
				# case, and we simply return (1 is
				# already in %rax as the return value)
	
	je end_factorial	
	
				# reload our parameter into %rbx
	imulq %r8, %rax		# multiply that by the result of the decrement
				
	jmp start_loop
	
end_factorial:	
	movq %rbp, %rsp		# standard function return stuff - we	
	pop %rbp		# have to restore %rbp and %rsp to where
				# they were before the function started
				# Note: exit codes ($?) > 255 will be
				# displayed are not correct.
	
	ret			# return to the function (this pops the
				# return value, too)
