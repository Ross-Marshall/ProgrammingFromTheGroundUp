#PURPOSE:	Program to illustrate how functions work
#		This program will compute the value of
#		2^3 + 5^2 = 8 + 25 = 33
#

#
# Everything in the main program is stored in registers,
# so the data section doesnâ€™t have anything.
#
# Modified for 64 bit compilation (eax ==> rax, ebx ==> rbx, etc...)
