#PURPOSE:	Program to illustrate how functions work
#		This program will compute the value of
#		2^3 + 5^2
#

#
# Everything in the main program is stored in registers,
# so the data section doesnâ€™t have anything.
#
# Modified for 64 bit compilation (eax ==> rax, ebx ==> rbx, etc...)

# PURPOSE: This function is used to compute		
# the value of a number raised to		
# a power.		
#		
# INPUT: First argument - the base number		
# Second argument - the power to		
# raise it to		
#		
# OUTPUT: Will give the result as a return value		
#		
# NOTES: The power must be 1 or greater		
#		
# VARIABLES:		
# %rbx - holds the base number		
# %ecx - holds the power		
#		
#  -4(%ebp) - holds the current result		
#		
#  %rax is used for temporary storage		
#
