# PURPOSE - 	Given a number, this program computes the	
#  		factorial. For example, the factorial of	
#  		3 is 3 * 2 * 1, or 6. The factorial of	
#  		4 is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, or 24, and so on.	
# 	
# 	This program shows how to call a function recursively.

factorial:	
	push %rbp		# standard function stuff - we have to
				# restore %rbp to its prior state before
				# returning, so we have to push it
	
	movq %rsp, %rbp 	# This is because we donâ€™t want to modify	
				# the stack pointer, so we use %rbp.

	movq 16(%rbp), %rax 	# This moves the first argument to %rax	
				# 4(%rbp) holds the return address, and
				# 8(%rbp) holds the first parameter

	movq %rax, %rbx		# store value in %rax to %rbx
	
start_loop:

	cmpq $1, %rbx		# If the number is 1, that is our base
				# case, and we simply return (1 is
				# already in %rax as the return value)	
	je end_factorial	

	decq %rbx		# subtract 1 from %rbx

	imulq %rbx, %rax	# multiple the values answer is stored
				# in %rax
	
	jmp start_loop		# return to the top of the loop
	
end_factorial:	

	push %rax		# push it for our call to factorial

	movq %rbp, %rsp		# standard function return stuff - we
	
	pop  %rbp		# have to restore %rbp and %rsp to where
				# they were before the function started
	
	ret			# return to the function (this pops the
				# return value, too)
